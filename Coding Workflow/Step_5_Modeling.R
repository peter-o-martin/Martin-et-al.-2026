# relationship. We would expect that, if the model has good predictive accuracy,
# that a linear regression of observed vs predicted concentration values would yield
# a slope estimate of 1 and an intercept estimate of 0. In other words, there would be
# no significant differences between observed PFOS concentrations and the values that  
# the model predicts from the set of predictor variables and predictor-response 
# relationships that we have specified.

# Significant Outlier and KS tests, some quantile deviations
# The other diagnostics (see below) show a good fit to the data that can accurately predict test values

testOutliers(full_PFTrDA_gam) 
# Not too many outliers (would expect some in environmental contaminant data, especially
# since our literature search includes some publications that recorded concentrations
# after major spill events)
# And we intentionally picked a data distribution family (scaled-t) that is robust to
# outliers and can still make accurate predictions of test data (see below)
